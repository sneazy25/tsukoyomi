## About

I made this program for multiple reasons. The first was to learn how to use APIs and for general programming practice. I do not use Python a lot because everyone knows Java is the superior language. The second reason was because I saw someone selling the same program for $10/month, so I thought: "why not open source it."  

### How to Use

1. Install Python 3.x
2. Install all the required modules `pip(3) install -r requirements.txt`
3. Edit `config.json` and change the `username`, `password`, `caption`, and `interval`
4. Run `python(3) poster.py` in your terminal
5. Sit back and relax!

### To-Do
  
  - Make a GUI
  - Add more features
  
### Known Issues

  - Nothing because my programs are perfect
